If you haven't added any new directories you can just run the following:

php update_symlinks.php /projects/csg/html/user/climate_lwingate/

And it should update the symbolic links that the webserver is using as the webpages.  You can check them with:

ls -la /projects/csg/html/user/climate_lwingate/
